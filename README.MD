# PyInvaders

I started out by copying code from a Linux Format Magazine PyGame tutorial in 2008. Then I modified it using lessons I learned from other tutorials they published with other games. This game uses Python 2 and will cause issues on Python 3. Some time in the future when I have less to do (so maybe never?) I will make the minor fixes needed for Python 3 compatibility.
